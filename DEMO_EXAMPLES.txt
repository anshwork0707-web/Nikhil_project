🎬 COMPLETE DEMO SCRIPT (5-7 MINUTES)
================================================================================

STEP 1: Introduction (30 seconds)
----------------------------------
Say: "This is Study Planner - a web app that converts natural language into 
organized study schedules using NLP and algorithms."

Show: Homepage with clean UI


STEP 2: Add Task via Natural Language (1 minute)
-------------------------------------------------
Type: "I have a math exam tomorrow 2 hours"
Click: "Add Task from Text"
Point out: 
  - Subject automatically detected: Math
  - Deadline parsed: Tomorrow's date
  - Duration extracted: 120 minutes
  - Task appears in list below


STEP 3: Add More Tasks Quickly (1 minute)
------------------------------------------
Type: "Physics homework on 2025-11-25 90 minutes"
Click: Add
Type: "Chemistry lab report today 3 hours"
Click: Add
Say: "The system handles various date formats and duration expressions"


STEP 4: Show Form Input Method (45 seconds)
--------------------------------------------
Fill form:
  - Subject: Biology
  - Title: Genetics Problem Set
  - Deadline: 2025-11-22
  - Duration: 60 minutes
Click: "Add Task"
Say: "Users can also use structured forms for precise control"


STEP 5: View Task List (30 seconds)
------------------------------------
Scroll through task list
Point out:
  - Color-coded subjects
  - Deadline dates visible
  - Duration shown
  - Complete/Delete buttons
  - Statistics at top updating


STEP 6: Generate Schedule (1 minute)
-------------------------------------
Set: 180 minutes available
Click: "Generate Schedule"
Explain output:
  - Tasks sorted by deadline (earliest first)
  - Time slots assigned (6 PM start)
  - Duration allocation shown
  - Remaining time displayed
Say: "The algorithm prioritizes urgent tasks automatically"


STEP 7: Mark Complete & Regenerate (45 seconds)
------------------------------------------------
Click: "Complete" on one task
Show: Task grays out, stats update
Click: "Generate Schedule" again
Show: Updated schedule without completed task
Say: "System dynamically adjusts as you complete tasks"


STEP 8: Explain Algorithm (30 seconds)
---------------------------------------
Say: "The planner uses a greedy algorithm:
  1. Fetch pending tasks
  2. Sort by deadline
  3. Allocate time from earliest deadline
  4. Stop when time runs out
Simple but effective for student scheduling!"


STEP 9: Technical Overview (30 seconds)
----------------------------------------
Say: "Built with:
  - Python Flask backend
  - SQLite database
  - Regex-based NLP
  - Vanilla JavaScript frontend
  - Responsive CSS design"


STEP 10: Conclusion (30 seconds)
---------------------------------
Say: "This demonstrates a complete web application pipeline:
  Input → Parse → Store → Schedule → Display
Perfect for helping students manage their workload!"

❓ ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
================================================================================

Q1: "Why regex instead of advanced NLP like spaCy?"
A1: "For a first-semester project, regex is lightweight, fast, and educational.
     It works well for common patterns. spaCy integration is planned for v2.0."


Q2: "What if I enter an invalid date?"
A2: "The parser handles common formats. If unrecognized, deadline is set to NULL
     and the task is still saved. We could add validation in future versions."


Q3: "Can it handle recurring tasks?"
A3: "Not currently - it's designed for one-time tasks. Recurring tasks would be
     a great enhancement with a 'repeat' flag in the database."


Q4: "How does it prioritize tasks?"
A4: "Currently by deadline only - earliest deadline gets scheduled first.
     Future versions could add priority levels (high/medium/low) or difficulty."


Q5: "Is this scalable for many users?"
A5: "Current design is single-user with SQLite. For multi-user, we'd add:
     - User authentication
     - PostgreSQL database
     - Session management
     - Cloud deployment"


Q6: "What about task dependencies?"
A6: "Good question! Current version treats tasks independently. We could add
     a 'depends_on' field to create task chains in future iterations."


Q7: "Can I export the schedule?"
A7: "Not yet, but it's high on the roadmap. We plan to add:
     - PDF export
     - iCalendar (.ics) format
     - Google Calendar integration"


Q8: "What if tasks take longer than estimated?"
A8: "Users can adjust estimates manually. With usage data, we could implement
     ML to learn average durations per subject and auto-adjust predictions."

🎯 BACKUP PLAN (If Live Demo Fails)
================================================================================

Have ready:
□ Screenshots of each step (save in /screenshots folder)
□ Video recording of working demo
□ Printed code snippets
□ Database browser screenshot showing data

If internet fails:
✓ Show screenshots while narrating
✓ Display code in VS Code
✓ Explain architecture using whiteboard
✓ Promise to share working video link


================================================================================
💡 PRESENTATION TIPS
================================================================================

DO:
✓ Speak clearly and maintain eye contact
✓ Use the examples in order (they build on each other)
✓ Pause after each step to let audience absorb
✓ Point to specific UI elements with cursor
✓ Show enthusiasm for your project
✓ Explain WHY you made design choices

DON'T:
✗ Rush through the demo
✗ Read slides word-for-word
✗ Apologize for "simple" features
✗ Get flustered if something doesn't work
✗ Use jargon without explanation
✗ Skip the algorithm explanation
